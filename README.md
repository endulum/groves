# Groves

Groves is an arboreal semiclone of Reddit.

## Technologies

- React as the framework
- Vite as the bundler
- Style enforced with ESLint

### Missing features

- Stuff on profiles:
- - Most frequented communities
- - Verdancy score, with best posts/best replies?
- Wrap textareas with word counters
- "Bookmark" or "go to last unread" posts on global and personal feed
- Darkmode!
- actual nav

### Remaining issues

- What if OP is also an admin/mod? Extend `Username` to account for that?
