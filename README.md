# Groves

Groves is an arboreal semiclone of Reddit.

## Technologies

- React as the framework
- Vite as the bundler
- Style enforced with ESLint

### Missing features

- Wrap textareas with word counters
- Pin replies
- "Bookmark" or "go to last unread" posts on global and personal feed
- Allow frozen posts to be found (in comm and activity search), but also have a checkbox to exclude frozen

### Remaining issues

- profile content view duplicating posts - should get only content creation
