# Groves

Groves is an arboreal semiclone of Reddit.

## Technologies

- React as the framework
- Vite as the bundler
- Style enforced with ESLint

### Missing features

- CTA on guest index route that "introduces" Groves briefly
- Stuff on profiles:
- - Most frequented communities
- - Following communities (with buttons to unfollow if you're the user)
- - Verdancy
- Wrap textareas with word counters
- "Bookmark" or "go to last unread" posts on global and personal feed
- Darkmode!
- Check document title consistency
- Consider making global feed ranked by hotness rather than date posted?

### Remaining issues

- What if OP is also an admin/mod? Extend `Username` to account for that?
