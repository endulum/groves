# Groves

Groves is an arboreal semiclone of Reddit.

## Technologies

- React as the framework
- Vite as the bundler
- Style enforced with ESLint

### Missing features

- "Bookmark" or "go to last unread" posts on global and personal feed

### Remaining issues

- What if OP is also an admin/mod? Extend `Username` to account for that?
